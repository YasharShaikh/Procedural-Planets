**Procedural-Planets 🌌**
==========================

A Unity-based project to generate breathtaking procedural planets, combining dynamic mesh generation, realistic terrain shaping, and customizable biome-based color systems.

* Dynamic Planet Generation
  - Procedurally generate planets with varied terrains and colors based on defined settings.
* Biome System
  - A fully customizable biome system allowing gradient-based textures, tinting, and noise-based blending for realistic transitions.
* Shape Customization
  - Adjustable terrain shaping using noise filters for unique planetary surfaces.
* Material and Texture Management
  - Utilizes Unity's materials to dynamically apply textures and colors based on elevation and biome settings.
 * Interactive Editor Integration
   - Includes Unity Editor tools to visualize and tweak planet settings in real-time.

**Gameplay 🎮**
------------
* Generate unique planets with just a click.
* Experiment with settings to customize planet shapes, terrains, and biomes.
* Use editor tools to visualize changes in real-time.
  

**Getting Started 📃**
--------------
* Unity Version: 2023 or higher
* Basic knowledge of Unity and C# scripting.

**Building**
--------------
* Clone this repository
* Launch Unity Hub, add the cloned folder, and open it. 
* Open the MainScene and hit play to see your procedural planets come to life.
* Use the custom editor tools to tweak shape, color, and biome settings directly in the Unity Inspector.

**Core Components 🛠️**
--------------
**Scripts**
*  ColorGenerator: Handles biome-based texture generation with gradient and tint support.
*  ShapeGenerator: Manages terrain shaping using customizable noise filters.
*  TerrainFaces: Splits the planet into 6 manageable faces for efficient mesh generation.


**Scriptable Objects**
*  ShapeSettings: Define terrain noise and elevation properties.
*  ColorSettings: Configure biome colors, blending, and noise-based variations.

  
**Custom Editor**
*  Interactive editor script to adjust planet settings and preview changes in real-time.
